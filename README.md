1) Overview
This repository is made for a final project in a data science training programm with the Data Science institute.
The aim of the project is to use publicly available data to create a ML based prediction model to asses ones risk of getting cancer as well as a streamlit based web interface to use the prediction model.


2) Data Aquisition
The data was aquired from public sources (i.e. nhanes and RKI) for cancer research.


3) Choice of ML Model
Severeal ML models were tested, both supervised as well as unsupervised. 
The unsupervised model which was tested was Gaussian Mixture Modelling (GMM) as this would directly yield probabalistic results. It was ultimately discarded because no gut cluster separation could be achieved.
For the unsupervised ML three were tested: Random Forest, Decision Trees and Logistic Regression wherein Logistic Regression yielded the best results and was subsequently chosen for the Analysis and prediction calculator.
